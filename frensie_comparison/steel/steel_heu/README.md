naming convention goes as follows:
files with one number (e.g. steel_heu_A) have the heu sphere at coordinates (A,A,A)

files with three numbes (e.g. steel_heu_A_B_C) have the heu sphere at coordinates (A,B,C)

note that the coordinate system in Trelis has the origin at the center of the meter cube
the coordinate system convention previously has the the origin in trelis at (50,50,50) cm
